# Web-scraper-for-news-headlines
This project is a Python script that automates the collection of news headlines from a website. It uses the requests library to download the HTML of a news site and BeautifulSoup to parse that HTML. It then finds all the headline elements, extracts the text, and saves the clean list of headlines into a local .txt file.
